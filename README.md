 ### View the live project [here.]()

This website has been created as my submission for Milestone Project 1 
for the Code Institute. It is for the Irish company *Water Stations Ireland*. 
The company are looking to create an online presence for their business
and to increase the sales of their water stations. The website is designed to be 
both accessible and responsive on a range of devices in order to create 
navigation ease for potential customers looking to find more information about
the company and/or to enquire about their products.
