 ### View the live project [here.]()

This website has been created as my submission for Milestone Project 1 
for the Code Institute. It is for the Irish company ***Water Stations Ireland***. 
The company are looking to create an online presence for their business
and to increase the sales of their water stations. The website is designed to be 
both accessible and responsive on a range of devices in order to create 
navigation ease for potential customers looking to find more information about
the company and/or to enquire about their products.

## <p align="center">**UX**</p>

### **Strategy**
#### User Stories
- As a potential customer, I want to learn about the company, their values and their goals. 
- As a potential customer, I want to find detailed descriptions and clear images of the Water Stations the company offers. 
- As a potential customer, I want to easily be able to contact the company for further information.
- As a potential customer, I want to easily navigate through the website.
- As a potential customer, I want the website to be responsive on whichever device I’m viewing it on.
- As a potential customer, I want to explore a clean and professional website. 

#### Target Audience
The target audience for this website would be potential customers looking to 
enquire about and purchase sustainable Water Stations. Potential customers would
 include Local Authorities, Government Bodies, Business Owners, Schools/Universities. 

#### Site Owner Goals
- Establish an online presence for ***Water Stations Ireland***.
- Increase direct enquiries and purchases through the website.
- Have a functional and responsive website with a clean and professional look.
- Inform site visitors about who ***Water Stations Ireland*** are and what they do.
- Provide information on the sustainability of the company and products. 
- Provide detailed information about the Water Stations on offer and the different options and features available.
- Showcase images of the Water Stations.
- Keep product prices off the site to encourage potential customers to contact the company for a quote.
- Provide a simple means for potential customers to make enquiries.

### **Scope**
- Information section about the company and their ethos must be provided.
- Images of the Water Stations must be displayed, accompanied by detailed descriptions of the different options offered.
- A clear means of contacting the company must be provided via a contact form and a display of the company’s phone, email and social media accounts. 
- The company wants their logo on display and so it will remain fixed to the top of the page consistently across the site.
- A fixed navigation menu must be included to always allow users to make their way through the site easily.
- The site must showcase the professionalism of the company and so it must have a clean and modern layout and design. 
- The site must be visually consistent to make users comfortable.
- The site must be responsive across different devices. 
- A map showcasing where Water Stations have already been purchased and installed will be left as a feature to be implemented at a later date and so will **not** be included in this release. 

### **Structure**
The website will consist of four separate and structured pages; *Home*, *About*, *Our 
Products* and *Contact*. Each page will be consistent in terms of layout and design
so that the user is comfortable. The same navigation menu and footer will be 
present across all pages to allow for navigation ease. Three of the four pages
will contain the same hero image. The *Home* page will differ slightly and will
have a hero video rather than image with the company slogan *“Ireland’s Premier
Water Stations”* displayed on top. All of this will apply to the site across 
all devices. 

#### Home Page
- Will contain an introduction telling the user who the company is and what it is that they do. 
- Will contain an image of a Water Station so the user can become familiar with their appearance immediately.
- Important to introduce the purpose straight away so that a user knows immediately what to expect from the site. 

#### About Page
- Will contain information about the company’s values and goals.
- Will contain information about the sustainability of the company and its products.
- Important to have this information clear on the site so that a potential customer knows if the company’s ethos aligns with their own. 

#### Our Products Page
- Will contain detailed information about the different Water Stations available and the different options they offer.
- Will contain different images of the Water Stations.
- Important to include this so that a potential customer can see real-life images of the products they’re interested in and clear information about what is included with each type of Water Station.

#### Contact Page
- Will contain the company’s phone number, email, address and social media links.
- Will contain a form for users to fill out with fields for Name, Email, Phone Number, and a Submit button.
- All form fields will be required.
- Users will be alerted if any of the required fields are left blank or filled out incorrectly.

#### Navigation Bar
- Will remain fixed to the top of each page for consistency across all pages and devices; it will take on a hamburger menu style on smaller devices for a cleaner and less cramped appearance. 
- Will contain clear names of each site page for navigation ease.

#### Footer
- Will remain fixed at the bottom of each page for consistency across all pages and devices. 
- Will contain the company’s contact information; phone and email, as well as a link to the contact form on the Contact Page. 
- Will contain links to the company’s social media accounts; Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, in the form of the appropriate icons. 
- Will contain two logos as requested by the company; their own and *Guaranteed Irish*. 

#### Links
- All links will change colour when hovered over to make it clear to the user that they are links.
- External links, i.e. to social media accounts, will open in a new tab so that users will not have to leave the site.
- *Terms* and *Privacy Policy*, contained in the footer, will open as downloadable PDFs in a new tab.  
- Internal links will all work and lead the user to the correct place within the site. 
- The company logo will also act as a link to the *Home Page*. 

### **Skeleton**

### **Surface**
#### Design
The overall design for the site will be clean and simple, allowing users 
to discover the information they need without being distracted by flashy 
colours or imagery. It’s important that a professional feel is portrayed 
by maintaining consistency in the design throughout. Water plays a large 
role in the design which helps to create a clear and flowing site.

#### Colour
I was provided with the main colour the company use for their logo; <span style="color:#1F89E0">#1F89E0</span>. 
I used this as my base to build a colour scheme using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) 
as seen below. As the company wanted a professional and clean look for the site I 
chose to keep the scheme simple, nothing too bold to distract the eye. I 
also felt it was appropriate to stick to blue tones to represent water which 
is, of course, the main element at play for this company. This video on the 
*Home Page* was also chosen for this reason, the colours work well with the 
overall crisp tone of the site. 
- <span style="color:#1F89E0">#1F89E0 Bleu de France</span>
- #FFFFFF White
- <span style="color:#0C375A">#0C375A Prussian Blue</span>
- <span style="color:#161412">#161412 Smoky Black</span>

![Colour Scheme](documentation/colourscheme.png)

It was important to ensure legibility of the text on the background it would be 
displayed on so I also used *Contrast Checker* on [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to ensure there would
 be no issues with my chosen palette. 

#### Typography
The company use the font <span style="font-family:Montserrat">Montserrat</span> in their brochures and logos and so I decided 
to keep this as the font for the headings and navigation menu for consistency. I 
opted for <span style="font-family:Raleway">Raleway</span> as the secondary font for the main content on the site as the 
two fonts work well together to create a sleek and modern look. 

#### Images
For the landing page, I used a video of a water droplet from [Coverr.co](https://coverr.co/). I chose a 
video, and this one in particular, as I wanted the landing page to have some 
fluidity. The simple water drop helps to set the tone of the site while acting as 
the backdrop to the company’s slogan, *"Ireland’s Premier Water Stations"*. 

For the remaining three pages the video is replaced by a hero image of one of the 
company’s Water Stations. I felt the video would become too repetitive if added 
across all pages and so I chose an image instead. The same opaque overlay and title 
format used however, keeps the design consistency flowing.
